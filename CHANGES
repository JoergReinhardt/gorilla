Go1 development version
-----------------------
- Changed import paths to follow gofix recommendation. New ones:
	- code.google.com/p/gorilla/appengine/sessions
	- code.google.com/p/gorilla/context
	- code.google.com/p/gorilla/mux
	- code.google.com/p/gorilla/schema
	- code.google.com/p/gorilla/sessions
	- code.google.com/p/gorilla/rpc/jsonrpc
- context:
	- Big clean up. Context keys are now interface{} so packages can
		define custom types to avoid name collisions. As a result,
		Namespaces became irrelevant and were dropped.
	- Usage is much simpler. See updated documentation.
- mux:
	- URL(), URLHost() and URLPath() now return (url, error).
		URLDebug(), URLHostDebug() and URLPathDebug() were removed.

------------------
- Dropped mux.NewRouter(): new(mux.Router) will work fine.
