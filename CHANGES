About
=====
This file lists changes between tagged gorilla releases.

New releases are tagged twice, as "go1" and using the release
version, e.g. "r2012.04.05". So the go tool will always get the
latest version and a specific version can be pulled using its tag.

Changes that are not backward compatible are highligthed below
using an exclamation mark between brackets, as in "[!]".

Development version
-------------------
- [!] securecookie: changed decoding order to decrypt only after
	HMAC was successfully verified. As a result existing values
	will fail to decode.
- [Fix] rpc/json: DecodeClientResponse now properly returns the
	error from the RPC call, if any, instead of trying to decode the
	result. Thanks, Graham Miller.
- Added package appengine/context: it creates a testing context
	during tests but a standard appengine.Context when built in
	production. THis was extracted from appengine/sessions.
- mux: the StrictSlash option is now ignored for path prefixes,
	as it must be.

gorilla r2012.04.05
-------------------
First stable release after Go 1.
